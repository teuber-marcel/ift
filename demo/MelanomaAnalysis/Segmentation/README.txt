Usage:

This folder contains three applications for automatic skin lesion image segmentation.

A dataset is a folder containing a subfolder named orig, which contains ppm images of skin lesions.

The application lesion_seg receives a path to a dataset, a path to output the segmentations and a threshold for foreground component size (as a proportion to the size of the image).
Example usage:
lesion_seg ~/projects/data/MelanomaSet1/ seg1 0.01
This creates the folder seg1 containing two subfolders: labels and vis. The folder labels contains a representation of the segmentation for each image stored as a pgm file (0 -> background, 1 -> object). The folder vis contains a human-friendly visualization of the same segmentations.

The application ift_lesion_seg receives a path to a dataset, an output created by the application lesion_seg.c (explained previously), a path to output the segmentations and the parameter erosion/dilation radius. This application uses the image foresting transform based on superpixels to enhance the segmentations given by the previous application.
Example usage:
ift_lesion_seg ~/projects/data/MelanomaSet1/ seg1 seg2 10
This creates the folder seg2 containing two subfolders: labels and vis. The folder labels contains a representation of the segmentation for each image, stored as a pgm file (0 -> background, 1 -> object). The folder vis contains a human-friendly visualization of the same segmentations.

The application lesion_superseg receives a path to a dataset, a path to output oversegmentations and a number of superpixels.
Example usage:
lesion_superseg ~/projects/data/MelanomaSet1 overseg 300.
In this case, the folder ~/projects/data/MelanomaSet1 must also contain a subfolder named labels, containing the correct segmentation for each image. This segmentation can be generated by either application detailed above. The application creates a folder named overseg containing two folders: labels and vis. The folder labels contains a representation of an oversegmentation as a pgm image (one number is associated to each superpixel). The folder vis contains a human-friendly representation of the same oversegmentation.
