# IFT

# Installation

To install the library, first make sure the dependencies listed in requirements.txt are satisfied. Run `make` inside the root folder to compile the library.

This library uses an environment variable called `NEWIFT_DIR`. Make sure it is exported with `export NEWIFT_DIR=path_to_lib` or add it to the `bashrc` file.

To install the PyIFT wrapper, execute the `install-pyift.sh`script after the compilation of the IFT.
