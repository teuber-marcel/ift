### **Final Grade Calculation**

```
Final Grade = (Assignment1 + Assignment2 + Assignment3) / Number of Assignments
```

### **Final Grade Scale**

- **Concept A**: [8.5, 10.0] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Excellent)
- **Concept B**: [7.0, 8.5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Good)
- **Concept C**: [5.0, 7.0) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Satisfactory)
- **Concept D**: [0.0, 5.0) ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Unsatisfactory)

## üìà **Grading Breakdown Example**

### **Sample Assignment Evaluation**

```
Assignment 1 (Image Processing Fundamentals):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code Implementation (40%): 8.5/10
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Report Quality (35%): 9.0/10
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Classroom Participation (25%): 8.0/10
Final Assignment Grade: 8.5/10
```

### **Final Grade Calculation Example**

```
Student with 3 assignments:
Assignment 1: 8.5/10
Assignment 2: 9.0/10
Assignment 3: 8.0/10

Final Grade = (8.5 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 8.5
Final Concept: A (Excellent)
```
