# üéâ MO445 Environment Setup Complete!

Your MO445 environment has been successfully set up and is ready to use!

## ‚úÖ What Was Installed

1. **Miniconda** - Python environment manager
2. **MO445 Conda Environment** - Isolated environment with all dependencies
3. **PyIFT** - Python wrapper for the IFT (Image Foresting Transform) library
4. **MO445 Notebooks** - Complete course materials downloaded from UNICAMP
5. **All Required Packages**:
   - NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
   - Jupyter, Pandas, Seaborn
   - Scikit-learn, Scikit-image
   - PIL (Pillow)
   - PyTorch (for deep learning tutorials)

## üöÄ How to Start Working

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)

```bash
./start_mo445.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Activation

```bash
# Activate the environment
conda activate mo445

# Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## üìö Available Course Materials

The following notebooks are now available in the `notebooks/` directory:

### Core Image Processing Notebooks

- `ConnectedOperators.ipynb` - Connected operators for image processing
- `MathMorphology.ipynb` - Mathematical morphology operations
- `Skeletonization.ipynb` - Image skeletonization techniques
- `Watershed.ipynb` - Watershed segmentation
- `Labeling.ipynb` - Connected component labeling
- `Convolution.ipynb` - Convolution operations

### Advanced Topics

- `segmentation_and_classification/` - Complete segmentation and classification tutorials
  - Parasite classification with FLIM data
  - Citrus leaf disease classification
  - Neural network training with backpropagation
- `pytorch_introduction/` - PyTorch deep learning tutorials

### Data Sets

- Parasite images and labels
- Citrus leaf images with disease annotations
- FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) data
- Pre-trained models and network architectures

## üîß Environment Details

- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **PyIFT Version**: 0.2.0
- **Environment Name**: mo445
- **Location**: `~/miniconda3/envs/mo445`

## üìù Important Notes

1. **OpenCV Compatibility**: OpenCV has some compatibility issues on macOS, but the core functionality works. Most notebooks should run without issues.

2. **PyIFT**: The Python wrapper for the IFT library is working correctly and ready to use.

3. **Data Sets**: All course data sets are included in the notebooks directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you encounter issues:

1. **Environment not found**:

   ```bash
   conda env list
   conda activate mo445
   ```

2. **PyIFT import error**:

   ```bash
   conda activate mo445
   python -c "import pyift; print('PyIFT working!')"
   ```

3. **Jupyter not starting**:
   ```bash
   conda activate mo445
   pip install jupyter
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Run `./start_mo445.sh` to start working
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory in Jupyter
3. Start with the basic notebooks like `Convolution.ipynb` or `Labeling.ipynb`
4. Progress to more advanced topics in the `segmentation_and_classification/` directory

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues, the environment has been tested and verified to work. All core functionality including PyIFT, NumPy, Matplotlib, and the course notebooks are operational.
