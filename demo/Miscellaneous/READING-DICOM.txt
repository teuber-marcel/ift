Write a C program to read a sequence of raw files, converting it into
a scene file. This program will need to execute from command line the
following programs:

gdcmconv: to uncompress each dicom file, creating an uncompressed one
gdcmraw: to convert the uncompressed file into a raw file.

Your program will also need to input dimensions and voxel size. This
information can be obtained with gdcminfo, executed on consecutive
dicom files.
