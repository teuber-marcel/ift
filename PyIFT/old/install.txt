Installation steps for linux.

Install Jupyter-Notebook (recommended for image display)
1 - python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
2 - python3 -m install jupyter

Compile swig files
3 - make

Install PyIFT on python modules directory
4 - sudo python3 setup.py install

Done! Installation complete.

	When importing the module on python it might happen to crash
with undefined reference error, this happens because a function
from pyift.i was removed from libIFT (C library).
	To fix this it is necessary to remove the function from the 
pyift.i and recompile the swig files and reinstall PyIFT.
