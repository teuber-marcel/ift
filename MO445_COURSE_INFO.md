## üìä **Examination & Grading System**

### **Evaluation Criteria**

The evaluation is based on **practical assignments** (minimum one, maximum three) according to the following criteria:

1. **Student participation in classroom activities**
2. **Quality of reports for each assignment**
3. **Quality of implemented code** (in C/Python) with documentation

### **Grading Scale**

Each assignment receives a grade from [0,10], and the final grade is the arithmetic mean of the assignment grades, resulting in the following final concepts:

- **Concept A**: Average in [8.5, 10.0] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Concept B**: Average in [7.0, 8.5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Concept C**: Average in [5.0, 7.0) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Concept D**: Average in [0.0, 5.0) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

### **Report Requirements**
