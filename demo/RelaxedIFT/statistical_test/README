This is the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD code. These methods
are enough to test statistical significance between sets of samples. It works
for 2, 3, ..., N set of samples.


Parameters:
	Directory: A directory containing sets of samples. Each set is a text
			   file with the values separated by a delimiter.

	Example of directory:
		./error/
			method1.txt
			method2.txt
			method3.txt

		Inside each file:
			method1.txt
				0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9
			method2.txt
				0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9
			method3.txt
				0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9

	Delimiter: in the above example, the delimiter is space. Use '\ ' in the 
			   program call.

	Order: defines if the best possible result is a low number or
	a high number. For instance, measuring error, it is desired that the value
	is close to zero. But measuring accuracy, the closer to 1, the better.

	Confidence: It is the complement of the interval of confidence required.
				For a 95% confidence interval, use 1-0.95 = 0.05

	Output: The name of the text file that will be generated with the results.


Results:
	method1.txt = method2.txt
	method1.txt < method3.txt
	method2.txt = method3.txt


Interpretation:
	If the the order parameter was lowest, the results will be ordered in
	crescent order. (First line is the best method, and so on).
	The equal signs means that the method in the left is equivalent to the
	method in the right.
	The < sign means that the method in the left is statistically significant
	compared to the method in the right. And you also know that the method in
	the left is better, since it is an ordered list and it appeared first.
