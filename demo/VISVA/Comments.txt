register_modules.cpp
Use this file to comment functions of the menu.


visva.cpp 
Is the main file of the app. All the specifics are inside the modules folder.
General buttons are commented here.


The gradient is APP->arcw and it is computed by BrainGrad3(Scene *scn). Which is an Otsu and a threshold.



Each interactive dialog window has its correspondent .h. So add button id and wxButton pointer there.

The relax button appears when the semi-automatic segmentation method is clicked. You can configure the button and the action in the files:
Create and define the function:
interactivedialog.cpp

The function that it runs (Relax())
moduleinteractive.cpp


Use moduleinteractive.h and interactivedialog.h to fix the functions protypes.



The spinbox component is called: wxSpinCtrl *spinSlice;
Example on file sliceview.h and sliceview.cpp
